# 👻🔐 OpenADP Ghost Notes

**Session-based secure note taking with distributed cryptography protection**

## 🚨 The Problem with Traditional PIN Security

The original Ghost Notes used PBKDF2 to "strengthen" a user's PIN, but this approach has a fundamental flaw:

```javascript
// Traditional approach - VULNERABLE to brute force
const pin = "1234";  // Only 10,000 possible combinations
const key = pbkdf2(pin, salt, 100000);  // Still crackable in seconds
```

**A 4-digit PIN can be brute-forced in seconds**, even with 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations!

## 🛡️ The OpenADP Solution

OpenADP (Open Authenticated Data Protection) uses **distributed secret sharing** to make even simple PINs unbreakable:

```javascript
// OpenADP approach - SECURE with distributed cryptography
const result = await generateEncryptionKey(
    'ghost-notes-vault',
    pin,                    // Same PIN, but now secure!
    userID,
    10,                     // max attempts
    0,                      // no expiration
    openadpServers          // distributed servers
);
```

## 🔐 How OpenADP Protects Your PIN

### Traditional Security Model
- **Single point of failure**: PIN + local salt = crackable
- **Offline attacks**: Attacker only needs encrypted data
- **Brute force time**: ~5 seconds for 4-digit PIN

### OpenADP Distributed Security Model
- **Threshold cryptography**: Requires 3-of-5 servers to recover key
- **No offline attacks**: Must interact with live servers
- **Rate limiting**: Each server enforces attempt limits
- **Distributed trust**: No single point of failure

   ✓ Correct PIN
   ✓ 3+ servers online
   ✓ Valid authentication

## 🚀 Implementation

### 1. Setup Phase
```javascript
// Generate unique user ID
const userID = generateUserID();

// Use OpenADP to create distributed vault
const result = await generateEncryptionKey(
    'ghost-notes-vault',
    userPin,
    userID,
    maxAttempts,
    0,
    openadpServers
);

// Store authentication codes securely
await storeAuthCodes(result.authCodes);
```

### 2. Unlock Phase
```javascript
// Recover encryption key from distributed servers
const recovered = await recoverEncryptionKey(
    'ghost-notes-vault',
    userPin,
    userID,
    openadpServers,
    threshold,
    authCodes
);

// Use recovered key for note encryption/decryption
const sessionKey = recovered.encryptionKey;
```

## 🔍 Security Comparison

| Feature | Traditional | OpenADP |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **PIN Security** | ❌ Brute-forceable | ✅ Distributed protection |
| **Attack Surface** | ❌ Single device | ✅ Must compromise 3+ servers |
| **Offline Attacks** | ❌ Possible | ✅ Impossible |
| **Rate Limiting** | ❌ Client-side only | ✅ Server-enforced |
| **Time to Crack** | ❌ Seconds | ✅ Practically impossible |

## 🎯 Attack Resistance

### Traditional Attack
```
Attacker has: encrypted_notes.dat
Time needed: ~5 seconds

for pin in range(10000):
    if decrypt(encrypted_notes, pin) == valid:
        print("CRACKED:", pin)
        break
```

### OpenADP Defense
```
Attacker needs: 3+ compromised servers + correct PIN
Time needed: Centuries (if even possible)

- Each server enforces rate limits
- Servers are geographically distributed
- Independent security domains
- Threshold cryptography prevents single points of failure
```

## 💡 Key Benefits
