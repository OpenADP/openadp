# OpenADP Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the overall goals, design, and phased implementation plan for building a robust, scalable, and maintainable test suite for OpenADP. The aim is to support rapid development, continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD), and high reliability for all core and auxiliary components.

---

## 2. Test Goals

- **Correctness**: Ensure all cryptographic, protocol, and business logic is implemented as specified.
- **Regression Prevention**: Catch breaking changes early and prevent regressions.
- **Security**: Validate that all security properties (auth, quotas, blinding, etc.) are enforced.
- **Coverage**: Achieve and maintain high code coverage (target: 90%+ for core logic).
- **Scalability**: Enable the test suite to grow with the codebase and support new features.
- **CI/CD Readiness**: Integrate with automated pipelines for every commit/PR.
- **Documentation**: Make tests readable and self-explanatory, serving as living documentation.

---

## 3. Test Types & Scope

- **Unit Tests**: Isolate and test individual functions/classes (e.g., cryptography, Shamir, Noise-NK, DPoP, key derivation, input validation).
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components (e.g., client-server flows, authentication, backup/recovery, multi-server quorum).
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user scenarios (e.g., full backup and recovery, error handling, multi-device flows).
- **Security/Negative Tests**: Attempt invalid operations, brute force, replay, and ensure correct rejection.
- **Performance/Load Tests**: (Future) Validate system behavior under load and with large datasets.
- **Fuzz/Property-Based Tests**: (Future) Use fuzzing and property-based testing for protocol robustness.

---

## 4. Framework & Tooling

- **Primary Language**: Python (pytest recommended for its power, readability, and ecosystem).
- **Test Discovery**: Use standard naming conventions (`test_*.py`, `Test*` classes, `test_*` functions).
- **Coverage**: Use `coverage.py` or `pytest-cov` to measure and report code coverage.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate with GitHub Actions (or similar) to run all tests and report coverage on every PR/commit.
- **Mocking/Isolation**: Use `unittest.mock` or `pytest` fixtures for isolating dependencies (e.g., network, IdP, storage).
- **Test Data**: Use fixtures and factories for generating test data (keys, tokens, shares, etc.).
- **Documentation**: All tests should have clear docstrings and comments.

---

## 5. Migration & Expansion Strategy

- **Audit Existing Tests**: Catalog all current manual and script-based tests.
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Convert scripts and ad-hoc tests into proper unit/integration tests.
- **Test Coverage Baseline**: Measure current coverage and identify gaps.
- **Prioritize Core Logic**: Focus first on cryptography, protocol, and security-critical code.
- **Parallelize**: Where possible, write new tests in parallel with refactoring old ones.
- **CI Integration**: Add tests to CI as soon as they are stable.
- **Documentation**: Update test plan and code comments as the suite evolves.

## 6. Implementation Plan (Phased)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Framework
- Select and configure `pytest` as the primary test runner.
- Set up `pytest-cov` for coverage reporting.
- Establish test directory structure (e.g., `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/e2e/`).
- Add initial CI workflow (GitHub Actions or similar) to run tests and report coverage.
- Write example unit tests for a few core functions (e.g., Shamir split/combine, HKDF, curve ops).

### Phase 2: Unit Test Migration & Expansion
- Catalog all existing test scripts and manual test cases.
- Refactor and migrate these into `tests/unit/` as proper `pytest` tests.
- Add missing unit tests for all core modules (cryptography, protocol, auth, error handling).
- Ensure all tests are isolated (no network, no real IdP, no real servers).
- Achieve at least 70% code coverage for core logic.

### Phase 3: Integration & E2E Tests
- Write integration tests for client-server flows (using test servers, mocked IdP, etc.).
- Add E2E tests for full backup/recovery, error cases, and multi-server quorum.
- Use fixtures to spin up/tear down test environments.
- Add negative/security tests (invalid tokens, replay, brute force, etc.).
- Target 90%+ code coverage for all critical paths.

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing & Automation
- Add property-based/fuzz tests for protocol and cryptographic routines.
- Add performance/load tests for server and client.
- Integrate static analysis and linting into CI.
- Add mutation testing (optional, for critical code).
- Automate test data generation and test environment setup.

### Phase 5: Maintenance & Continuous Improvement
- Monitor coverage and test health in CI.
- Require tests and coverage for all new features/PRs.
- Regularly review and refactor tests for clarity and maintainability.
- Expand tests as new features and protocols are added.
