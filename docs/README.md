# OpenADP Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for the OpenADP project.

## Documentation Index

### Development & Architecture
- **[SDK Implementation Plan](SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - Comprehensive plan for building Python and JavaScript SDKs with identical functionality to the Go client
- **[Client Cleanup Plan](CLIENT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md)** - Plan for cleaning up the Go client architecture before implementing multi-language clients
- **[Client Interfaces](../pkg/client/interfaces.go)** - Standardized interfaces for cross-language client implementations

### SDK Development
- **[Python SDK Structure](../sdk/python/)** - Python SDK implementation with standardized interfaces
- **[JavaScript SDK Structure](../sdk/javascript/)** - JavaScript SDK implementation with standardized interfaces
- **[Cross-Language Testing](../sdk/shared/integration-scripts/)** - Comprehensive compatibility testing framework

### Security
- Previous security review findings and Ed25519 point validation improvements are documented in the conversation history
- Server public key security improvements implemented in decrypt tool
- **[Cryptographic Algorithm Changes](CRYPTO_ALGORITHM_CHANGES.md)** - Change from ChaCha20-Poly1305 to AES-256-GCM for cross-platform compatibility

### Multi-Language Implementation
The SDK Implementation Plan includes detailed guidance for implementing OpenADP clients in:
- **Python** - Full SDK with CLI tools, 90%+ test coverage, PyPI packaging
- **JavaScript** - Full SDK with CLI tools, 90%+ test coverage, npm packaging
- **Cross-Language Compatibility** - Files encrypted with any language can be decrypted with any other

## Quick Reference

### Current Status
- âœ… **Security Review**: Complete - no critical vulnerabilities found
- âœ… **Ed25519 Point Validation**: Implemented using cofactor clearing method
- âœ… **Standardized Interfaces**: Created for multi-language compatibility
- âœ… **SDK Implementation Plan**: Complete with 10-week timeline
- âœ… **Security Fix**: Decrypt tool now uses secure registry approach
- ðŸ”„ **SDK Development**: Ready to begin (Python â†’ JavaScript)

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Core infrastructure (JSON-RPC clients, basic operations)
- **Week 3-4**: Cryptographic foundation (Ed25519, AES-256-GCM, secret sharing)
- **Week 5**: Noise-NK protocol implementation
- **Week 6**: Advanced client features (multi-server, failover)
- **Week 7**: Key generation and file operations
- **Week 8**: Command-line tools
- **Week 9**: Integration and compatibility testing
- **Week 10**: Documentation and publishing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] **100% API compatibility** with Go client
- [ ] **Cross-language file compatibility** (encrypt with one, decrypt with another)
- [ ] **Identical CLI interfaces** across all languages
- [ ] **90%+ test coverage** for both SDKs
- [ ] **Performance within 20%** of Go client
- [ ] **Published packages** on PyPI and npm

### Key Files
- `docs/SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Complete implementation plan
- `pkg/client/interfaces.go` - Core interface definitions
- `pkg/client/client.go` - High-level multi-server client
- `pkg/client/encrypted_client.go` - Noise-NK encryption support
- `pkg/client/scrape.go` - Server discovery mechanism
- `sdk/python/` - Python SDK structure and examples
- `sdk/javascript/` - JavaScript SDK structure and examples
- `sdk/shared/integration-scripts/cross-language-test.sh` - Compatibility testing

### Next Steps
1. **Begin Phase 1** of SDK implementation (Python core infrastructure)
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** for automated cross-language testing
3. **Implement cryptographic foundations** with test vector validation
4. **Build JavaScript SDK** following Python implementation
5. **Publish packages** to PyPI and npm registries

### Getting Started with SDK Development
```bash
# Review the implementation plan
cat docs/SDK_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

# Examine the SDK structure
tree sdk/

# Run cross-language compatibility tests (when SDKs are implemented)
cd sdk/shared/integration-scripts/
./cross-language-test.sh
```

This documentation provides a complete roadmap for building production-ready OpenADP SDKs that maintain full compatibility with the Go implementation while providing excellent developer experience across multiple programming languages.
