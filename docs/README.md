# OpenADP Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for the OpenADP project.

## Documentation Index

### Development & Architecture
- **[Client Cleanup Plan](CLIENT_CLEANUP_PLAN.md)** - Comprehensive plan for cleaning up the Go client architecture before implementing multi-language clients
- **[Client Interfaces](../pkg/client/interfaces.go)** - Standardized interfaces for cross-language client implementations

### Security
- Previous security review findings and Ed25519 point validation improvements are documented in the conversation history

### Multi-Language Implementation
The Client Cleanup Plan includes detailed guidance for implementing OpenADP clients in:
- Python
- JavaScript  
- Java

## Quick Reference

### Current Client Status
- âœ… **Security Review**: Complete - no critical vulnerabilities found
- âœ… **Ed25519 Point Validation**: Implemented using cofactor clearing method
- âœ… **Standardized Interfaces**: Created for multi-language compatibility
- ðŸ”„ **Legacy Code Cleanup**: Recommended (optional)

### Next Steps
1. Implement Python client using standardized interfaces
2. Implement JavaScript client using standardized interfaces  
3. Implement Java client using standardized interfaces
4. (Optional) Clean up Go client legacy code
