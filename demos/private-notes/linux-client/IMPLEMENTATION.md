## Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Start)

### Step 1: Verify Crypto Foundation
```bash
cd demos/private-notes/linux-client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a simple test page to verify ChaCha20-Poly1305 works:
- Test encryption/decryption with our crypto-utils.js
- Verify browser compatibility
- Test content hashing (SHA-256)

### Step 2: Create TypeScript Type Definitions
Create `src/types/index.ts` with:
- Core interfaces (NotesContainer, Operation, VectorClock)
- Strict type definitions for all data structures
- Export all types for use across modules

### Step 3: Create Core Data Models
Create `src/js/data-models.ts` with:
- Typed NotesContainer implementation
- Operation types (CREATE/DELETE/EDIT) with full type safety
- Device ID generation with proper typing
- Content hash calculation with type guards

### Step 4: Implement Vector Clocks
Create `src/js/vector-clock.ts` with:
- Fully typed vector clock operations
- Type-safe causal ordering comparison
- Concurrent operation detection with proper return types

### Step 5: Build Operation System
Create `src/js/operations.ts` with:
- Type-safe operation creation functions
- Content-addressable note identification
- Comprehensive operation validation with type guards

This foundation will enable rapid development of the merge algorithm and storage layer in subsequent phases.

### OpenADP Integration Points

#### 1. Key Derivation
```javascript
// src/js/openadp-client.js
class OpenADPClient {
  async deriveEncryptionKey(pin, deviceId, appId) {
    // 1. Connect to OpenADP servers
    // 2. Generate authentication codes
    // 3. Perform distributed key derivation
    // 4. Return encryption key
  }
}
```

#### 2. PIN Recovery
```javascript
async recoverPIN(recoveryData) {
  // 1. Validate recovery data
  // 2. Contact OpenADP servers
  // 3. Perform threshold recovery
  // 4. Reconstruct original PIN
}
```

#### 3. Server Communication
```javascript
async communicateWithServers(operation, data) {
  // 1. Load server list
  // 2. Parallel requests to servers
  // 3. Handle failures gracefully
  // 4. Return aggregated result
}
```

### Security Considerations

#### 1. Data Protection
- Never store PIN in plaintext
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest
- Use secure random number generation
- Implement proper key derivation

#### 2. Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Validate all server responses
- Implement request timeouts
- Add retry mechanisms with backoff

#### 3. Client Security

- Implement Content Security Policy
- Prevent XSS and injection attacks
- Use secure coding practices

### Performance Targets

#### 1. Load Times
- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Note creation: < 500ms
- Note retrieval: < 1 second
- Sync operation: < 5 seconds

#### 2. Storage Efficiency
- Minimize storage footprint
