# Phase 3 Revert Summary

## What Was Reverted

Reverted commit `d200745` which implemented Phase 3 "Auth-Aware Server Logic" to prepare for a fundamentally better authentication approach.

### Removed Features:
- ‚ùå HTTP header-based DPoP authentication
- ‚ùå `owner_sub` column in database schema  
- ‚ùå Server-side ownership validation
- ‚ùå Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
- ‚ùå Authentication enforcement in JSON-RPC handlers
- ‚ùå Phase 3 test suites

### Why Revert?

The HTTP header authentication approach has concerning security implications:
- **Intermediary visibility**: Cloudflare/proxies can see all access tokens
- **Token substitution**: Middleboxes could theoretically replay/redirect tokens
- **Complex trust chain**: Security reasoning requires trusting all network hops
- **"Squishy" security**: Multiple potential attack vectors from intermediaries

## New Approach: Noise-NK Encrypted Authentication

See `docs/authn-authz-design.md` Section 8 for full details.

### Key Benefits:
- ‚úÖ **End-to-end encryption**: Intermediaries cannot see tokens
- ‚úÖ **Session binding**: Auth tied to specific Noise-NK session  
- ‚úÖ **Clean trust model**: Only client and server involved
- ‚úÖ **Simple reasoning**: "Decrypt + verify signature = authenticated"

### Implementation Plan:

#### Phase 3.5: Noise-NK Authentication Foundation
1. Extend Noise-NK to capture handshake hash
2. Add authentication payload structure
3. Implement handshake signing with DPoP keys
4. Update encrypted_call handler for auth validation
5. Add session-based user context

#### Phase 4: Server-Side Integration
1. Re-add database schema changes (owner_sub)
2. Re-implement ownership validation  
3. Re-add rate limiting within encrypted channel
4. Update all RPC methods for encrypted auth
5. Remove HTTP header auth compatibility

#### Phase 5: Client Integration  
1. Update client libraries to use encrypted auth
2. Modify encrypt.py/decrypt.py
3. Add fallback support for legacy servers
4. Update documentation

## Current State

**Back to clean Phase 2 foundation:**
- ‚úÖ Device flow authentication (Phase 1)
- ‚úÖ Noise-NK encryption (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Design doc updated with new approach
- üöß Ready to implement Phase 3.5

The codebase is now in a clean state to implement the superior Noise-NK authentication approach without the security concerns of the HTTP header method.
