Integration test for wrong password attempts and guess number tracking.

This test verifies that:
1. Wrong password attempts succeed in secret recovery but fail in final decryption
2. Subsequent attempts use the correct current guess number from listBackups
3. Correct password works after wrong attempts with proper guess tracking
