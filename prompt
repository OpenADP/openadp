We have been working on adding Keycloak authentication to our project.  Please read all README.md in the root of the project, and then docs/authn-authz-design.md, and then all the rest of the .md files in the root of the project.  We have completed Phase 3.5 and need to continue to phase 4.  I think in this phase we should update both the client and server at the same time, requiring DPoP authentication.  For now, we'll use Keycloak.  Please read the Python files in the project you think need to be updated, including client and server files.  After we get those updated, we'll test things with the encrypt/decrhypt tool in the tools directory.  Please pause after reading so we can talk about next steps.
