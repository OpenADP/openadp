Please read all README.md in the root of the project, and then docs/authn-authz-design.md, and then all the rest of the .md files in the root of the project. We have completed the initial prototype.  Please read all of the the Python files in the project, and then summarize the purpose of OpenADP and the overall architecture.  For example, why do we use distributed OpenADP servers?  When you understand the overall design in depth, pause and wait for user interaction.
