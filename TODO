# Server

* Clean up old database entries.  Pick how long 0 means (5 years?)
* Rerun fuzzing.  Automate this?

# Client

* Pick random servers distributed amonog countries, not concentrated in 1.
* Enhance tests to provide a server_list URL pointing to test servers.
* Add missing tests: using up last guess.
* Use futures and run all queries to servers in parallell.

# Ocrypt

* Add server_list URL as optional paramter to APIs.  Try to eliminate this single point of failure.

# Other

* Fix Ghost Notes  app, which seems quite unreliable, not due to Ocrypta.
* Redo test coverage exercise
* Ghithub Actions work to run tests before commits.
* Remaining guesses is always displayed as 10
* Test using up last guess
