# Server

* Clean up old database entries.  Pick how long 0 means (5 years?)
* Rerun fuzzing.  Automate this?
* Load testing and optimization
* Add functional test that verifies even/odd alternating with bad guesses in ocrypt.
* Functional test verifying we get no more guesses at some point.
* Offer alternative rate limiting, e.g. 10 guesses per day.

# Client

* Pick random servers distributed amonog countries, not concentrated in 1.
* Add missing tests: using up last guess.

# Ocrypt

* Add server_list URL as optional paramter to APIs.  Try to eliminate this single point of failure.

# Other

* Ghithub Actions work to run tests before commits.
