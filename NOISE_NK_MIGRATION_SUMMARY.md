# Noise-NK Implementation Migration Summary

## Files Reorganized

### Moved to `prototype/src/openadp/`
- **`noise_nk.py`** - Main NoiseNK class implementation
- **`noise_nk_demo.py`** - Usage demonstration and examples

### Moved to `prototype/src/`
- **`NOISE_NK_GUIDE.md`** - Complete implementation guide and API reference
- **`NOISE_NK_ENCRYPTION_DESIGN.md`** - Architecture design document for JSON-RPC encryption layer

### Updated Files
- **`prototype/src/openadp/__init__.py`** - Added exports for `NoiseNK` and `generate_keypair`

## Validation Complete

✅ **Module Testing**: Both `noise_nk.py` and `noise_nk_demo.py` run successfully in their new locations
✅ **File Organization**: All noise-related files moved from root to appropriate prototype directories
✅ **Package Integration**: NoiseNK class properly integrated into openadp package structure

## Next Steps for Implementation

Based on the architecture design in `NOISE_NK_ENCRYPTION_DESIGN.md`, the implementation phases are:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Implement server-side session management
- [ ] Add `noise_handshake` and `encrypted_call` handlers to JSON-RPC server
- [ ] Basic client library extension for encrypted calls

### Phase 2: Integration  
- [ ] Integrate with existing JSON-RPC handler in `prototype/src/server/`
- [ ] Add client-side `encrypted=True` parameter in `prototype/src/client/`
- [ ] Implement transparent 2-round flow
- [ ] Error handling and fallback logic

### Phase 3: Production Readiness
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Key distribution mechanism
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

## Key Design Decisions Documented

1. **Single Endpoint**: Same JSON-RPC endpoint handles both encrypted and unencrypted calls
2. **2-Round Encryption**: Separate handshake and encrypted call for clarity
3. **Session-Per-Call**: Sessions destroyed after single method call for perfect forward secrecy
4. **Transport Compatibility**: Designed to work through Cloudflare HTTP proxying

## Architecture Benefits

- **End-to-End Security**: Cloudflare cannot read method names, parameters, or responses
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing unencrypted methods continue to work unchanged
- **Simple Client API**: Just add `encrypted=True` to any existing method call
- **Defense in Depth**: Noise-NK encryption layered on top of TLS

The codebase is now properly organized and documented for implementing the Noise-NK encryption layer.
