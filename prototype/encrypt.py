OpenADP File Encryption Utility

This module provides file encryption functionality using ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD cipher
with Scrypt-based key derivation from passwords.

The encrypted file format is: [salt][nonce][encrypted_data]
- salt: 16 bytes for Scrypt key derivation
- nonce: 12 bytes for ChaCha20
- encrypted_data: Variable length ciphertext + authentication tag

Usage:
    python3 encrypt.py <filename_to_encrypt>
