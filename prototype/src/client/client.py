OpenADP Client (Legacy)

This is the legacy OpenADP client that used the old non-encrypted JSON-RPC protocol.
It has been replaced with a Noise-KK encrypted version.

For new development, please use:
- client_with_noise.py: Full-featured client with Noise-KK encryption
- noise_jsonrpc_client.py: Low-level Noise-KK JSON-RPC client

The old jsonrpc_client.py has been removed as part of the security upgrade.
All communications now use Noise-KK encryption over TLS for enhanced security.
