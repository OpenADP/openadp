Shamir Secret Sharing Implementation

This module implements Shamir's secret sharing scheme as described in:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing

Provides functions for:
- Creating random shares from a secret
- Recovering secrets from a threshold number of shares
- Working with elliptic curve points for OpenADP
